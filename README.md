# Tapey-Adventure
A game about the adventures of a broken tape recorder.
- My submission for the Brakeys Game Jam 2020.2

#### Theme : Rewind

### Initial Ideas :

#### Tape recorder :- 
- A tape recorder is thrown out of the window and all his parts are lost 
- He must find his way to the repair factory 
- He must collect his lost buttons :
  - Rewind : reverse time, not slow-mo
  - Pause : pause the time, off the player can move normally until his power runs out
  - Play : resumes everything to normal state
  - Forward : speed up time
- **Optional**[Extra collectibles : Tapes, playing these will give you extra points and act as precious collectibles, each tape has something interesting to play (music, story, conspiracy theory)]
- Use you antenna to kill enemies? 
- Recharge your power bar from power out let to use your buttonâ€™s special abilities
- Level is a simple platformer, no fancy stuff, just simple ground and levitating platforms
#### How does the player gets attacked?
- Enemies : 
   - Record machines who throws records at you 
- Environment : [**Optional**]
  - Thunder storm and rain can kill the player


#### Game Mechanics : 
- Simple left/right movement and jumping
- Can toggle different buttons 
- No way of shooting or killing the enemies just dodging 
- Players ammo is the tapes that he can throw onto the record players to destroy them
